# Getting help with PyJAS

## Have an issue?

If you have any issues with PyJAS, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/kmbhm1/PyJAS/issues/new/choose). However, please understand that this is a growing project and I may not be able to address all issues immediately or monitor as actively as a full time maintainer or team.

## Need help?

The API [documents](../api/api-reference.md) & [examples](../examples/simple-usage.md) are the best source reference documentation for PyJAS.
