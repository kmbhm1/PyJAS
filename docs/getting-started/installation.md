# Installation

To install the package, you can use the following command:

```bash

```

There are a few evolving dependencies that will need to be installed as well & to take note of:

- [pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/)-v2: A data validation and settings management using Python type annotations. We may integrate for v1 in the future.

If you have Python 3.10+ installed, you should be fine, but please [report](https://github.com/kmbhm1/PyJAS/issues/new/choose) any issues you encounter.
